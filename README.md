Pigeon
======

Pigeon is a collection of Object-Oriented CSS classes, useful
for kick-starting a web project. The project is a bit thin on
the ground right now, but I'll be adding more objects as I find
need for them. Feel free to fork and add your own!


Usage
-----

To use Pigeon, simply include `lib/pigeon.css` or
`lib/pigeon.min.css` in your project.

You can view/use the source for individual objects by digging
into the CSS files in the `src` directory.


Development
-----------

In order to develop Pigeon, you'll need to install the following
npm modules globally like so:

    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install -g jake

And then install development dependencies locally with:

    npm install

Once you have these dependencies, you will be able to run the
following commands:

`jake bundle`: Bundle CSS source files together.

`jake minify`: Create minfied versions of the bundled CSS files.

Work on files in the `src` directory, files in `lib` are
generated by the build tools. Also, I won't merge things in
unless you run `jake minify` :)
